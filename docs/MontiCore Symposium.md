## MontiCore Symposium 29. September - 02. October 2024

The first MontiCore Symposium is a meetup where language engineering and modeling enthusiasts can come together to discuss state-of-the-art software language engineering and model-driven techniques based on or associated with the technology of the MontiCore language workbench.


### Location

tbd

### Registration

Tickets are free but require registration via the following **[this link](ToDo)**.
Registration is possible until **13th of September**.

### Important Dates (deadlines extended)
* **22.04.2024**: Call for Presentations 
* **30.08.2024**: Submission Deadline
* **06.09.2024**: Acceptance Notification

### Preliminary Schedule

tbd


### Call for Presentations

We solicit talk proposals concerning the application, development, and innovation of language engineering or model-driven development around the language workbench MontiCore. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Novel meta-languages for language construction and composition
* Holistic approaches to language engineering in MontiCore that cross-cut multiple language aspects (e.g., abstract and concrete syntax, semantics, transformations) and/or integrate with program analysis, validation, testing, or other advanced techniques. 
* Industrial case studies: experience reports, large-scale evaluations, best practices, and human factors to adoption. 
* Low-Code / No-Code approaches based on MontiCore
  * Languages for describing and deriving digital twins
  * Languages for non-engineering issues, such as science, legal, social, or environmental sustainability issues
  * DSLs engineered on the basis of GPLs and GPMLs (general-purpose languages)
* Model-based and model-driven techniques for AI
* AI-based methods for language engineering and modeling within the MontiCore ecosystem
* MontiCore languages in action: Academic and industrial application of MontiCore and its languages

Presenters are encouraged to accompany their presentations with a **demo** or **reproduction package** that helps the participants to (easily) run and comprehend the presented tools, experiment with them, or tweak benchmark experiments. This helps to create a lasting contribution. 

**Talk proposals should be submitted by August 30 via [easychair](ToDo).** A proposal includes a title and a short (maximum 200 words) abstract.  In case the talk is accompanied by a demo, we encourage presenters to also provide a brief demo outline as part of the proposal. Presenters will be granted a flexible schedule for their presentations from 15 to 60 minutes. Please include the intended presentation time within your abstract. Presenters may choose to follow a traditional presentation style where the Q&A is at the end of the talk, or they may follow a chess timer-based style. Notifications about acceptance will be sent out by September 036.
